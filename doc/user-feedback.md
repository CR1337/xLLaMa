# User Feedback

## Feedback 1

- recommendations are cool but at first not clear what these buttons are
    - maybe add some kind of title

- X that closes a example is too small
    - did not expect that it closes the entire example

- display "Explain" textbox only when explain button was pressed

- colors are nice

## Feedback 2

- there schould be visual separators betwwen multiple code snippets in one example as it is not visually clear where one snippet ends and the next starts

- button that open documentation is super cool
    - there should be one for the source too

- when explanation is not needed there should be the possibility to display two examples side by side (possibility to customize the layout)

- didn't notice the possibility to click on functions inside the code
    - when told it was received as distracting
    - there should be a button to en/dis-able this feature
    - tester received it as negative for experience when there ia much underlined code

- would be cool when there are advanced options
    - like what kind of input the user wants to pass to the function
    - (eg: Generate an axample where a lambda function is passed as an argument)

- There should be a history of generated examples which reminds of what was generated so far and allows to restore already closed examples
