Here is the first code snippet:

```
from itertools import product

class Test:

    def __init__(self):
        self.x = [1, 2]
        self.y = ['a', 'b']

    def test(self):
        for x, y in product(self.x, self.y):
            print(x, y)
```

And here comes the second code snippet.
This time without backticks:

x = 42

def test():
    global x
    x += 1
    print(x)
    print(y)

This is some text at the end.
